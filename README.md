# Introduction
This repository contains files for the individual course project in SER594: Data Science for Software Engineers (2023) created by Jyothirmai Kantipudi for partial fulfillment of the course requirements.

Currently, the course staff (R. Acuna) has not cleared this project for public release, and must be kept within a private repository.

# Steps to Run the program

The dataset I've used exceeds 100 MB so I couldn't upload it to GitHub. Instead, as suggested by the professor I've uploaded it to my Drive and added an immutable link - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AIPiYVCyYcBiy_oj0V0eYRuRXuQMAJii/view?usp=share_link

And the link to the dataset from the website(to check the MD5 Hash) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/formula-1-trending-tweets/versions/20/data

1. Download the dataset from one of the links above
2. Place it in the data_original folder
3. Go to the directory ser594_23fc_project in your system and run python wf_core.py
4. This will directly create all the necessary plots, correlations, visualizations, models, train, test data sets, and summaries.
5. The data_original, data_processed, and rf_model are not present as they all exceed the data limit, but once you run the wf_core.py file, the processed data file and all the models will be created.
