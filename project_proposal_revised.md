Keywords: Sentiment Analysis, Social Media, F1

Description:
The aim of this research is to perform an extensive sentiment analysis on social media conversations during Formula 1 races. Data will be gathered from reputable online sources, with a primary focus on Twitter and Instagram. Advanced natural language processing methods will be employed to determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) in these discussions. The primary goal is to comprehend the intricate emotional dynamics during these events and pinpoint the underlying factors contributing to these sentiments. Additionally, the research will extract valuable insights regarding the impact of these events on brand endorsements and fan engagement, enhancing our understanding of the intricate interplay between sports, social media, and consumer behavior.

Research Questions:
   - RO1: To identify and describe the key trends and patterns within the sentiment analysis of social media conversations during major F1 events.
   - RO2: To predict the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of social media discussions during F1 races using a machine learning classification model.
   - RO3: To justify and defend the effectiveness and accuracy of the sentiment analysis model in predicting the sentiment polarity of F1 social media conversations.
   - RO4: To assess the insights and relationships derived from the sentiment analysis model(RO2) regarding the impact of public sentiment on brand endorsements and fan engagement during F1 events.

Intellectual Merit:
This project's intellectual merit lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between social media, major sporting events, and human emotions. While sentiment analysis in social media is not novel, its specific application in the context of significant athletic events remains relatively unexplored. This study aims to provide fresh insights into the development of public sentiment, the influencing factors, and their impact on brand endorsements and fan engagement during these high-profile events. The project seeks to uncover unexplored patterns, sentiment trends, and factors shaping public sentiment in the sports domain, leading to valuable scientific discoveries.


Data Sourcing:
For now I've F1_tweets.csv file but I'm planning to collect other relevant data for my project using a similar methodology:
   - Utilize social media platform APIs (e.g., Twitter and Instagram) for accessing F1-related posts, comments, and discussions.
   - Employ web scraping techniques to gather data from popular F1 forums and enthusiast boards.
   - Collect diverse data types, including text content, user details, timestamps, and metadata essential for sentiment analysis.
   - Apply filters using F1-related keywords, hashtags, and user handles to ensure data relevance and quality.
   - Explore partnerships with third-party data providers specializing in social media analytics to enrich the dataset and gain comprehensive insights into F1 event sentiments.
